        ~You do this in order to save somnething to the master branch so you can start making branches.
        ~NOTE: If you dont do the above then try to make a branch you will be just renaming your master branch.
            **ANTIDOTE Command: git branch -m master    **This command renames any current branch your on.

    //git add -A
        ~This adds all changes to the git staging area. 
        ~(git add -A): All files and directories everywhere in the git repository and branch that your in so can be executed anywhere.
        ~(git add .): All files and directories in the current directory and below it so this command matters wheer you execute it.
        ~To see what has been added to the stagin area or what isnt: 
            **Command: git status

    //git commit -m 'initial commit'
        ~You always execute this command after adding files and or directories you added to the staging area.
        ~This gives a commit message for all the files and directories in the current stagin area.
        ~After you will see there is nothing in the staging area unless you have untracked files and directories then you should be clean. 
        ~'initial commit' is the recommended commit message for your first commit

    //npm init -y
        ~Just like git init this command initializes instead of '.git' but package.json and sometimes package-lock.json

    //when a file is being changed so it is constantly watching for changes.
